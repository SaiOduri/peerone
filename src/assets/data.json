        "title":"3 Top Tips for Starting your Personal Statement",
        "type":"students",
        "text":"Writing your personal statement can be a daunting task, and many students spend hours crafting the perfect way to showcase their interests and talents. The opening of your personal statement can make or break whether someone will continue reading and ultimately accept you to the college. The first one or two sentences of your personal statement should reveal a little about your interests and personality without giving away everything that will be discussed throughout your writing. These are three memorable ways to start your personal statement this year to help you stand out from the hundreds of other applications your college admissions officer will be reading.\n\n1. Use a Hook\nUsing a hook in the first sentence is one of the best ways to grab your reader’s attention immediately. A short statement of just a line or two which showcases a little humor and adds intrigue is the perfect way to start your personal statement. You’ll want to immediately establish one of your main interests, whether that’s sport or science, and show that you are interested in academics. The hook acts as a way to transition into the story your personal statement will tell and encourages them to keep reading.\n\n2. Show Your Enthusiasm \nYour enthusiasm should shine through from the very first line of your college application. Whether that’s a neatly crafted line of writing or a statement about why you want to study a certain subject, your intent for the rest of the personal statement should come across clearly. Your personal statement allows you to be creative, so use this opportunity to show your enthusiasm for writing if this is something you are looking to pursue. College admissions officers love to see passion and interest in their college and courses, which should be apparent from your first line.\n\n3. Keep Things Current\nWhile past experiences should be drawn on throughout your personal statement, keeping your writing in the present is key to a successful college application. The college admissions officer should understand why you want to study at their college now and your current interests and passions. Avoid using “from a young age” or “since I was a child” in the opening line, as these are generic statements that are used too commonly in college applications. Your personal statement acts as a way to draw in the reader and should focus on your current and future education and not place too much emphasis on childhood dreams.\nYour personal statement is incredibly important for any college application and helps to showcase your personality away from just your good grades. When it comes to the introduction, you may find it easier to write the bulk of your personal statement and then come back to the introduction at the end. By this point, you’ll know exactly what’s covered in the writing, and you can link everything together to make a coherent piece of work. Your personal statement is a chance to shine and showcase your personality and talents, so ensure you don’t rush this part of your college application this year."

        "type":"students",
        "text":"While summer is a great time to rest and recuperate after a busy year at school, it’s the perfect time to further your skills. There are so many programs and ways you can make the most of the summer break, whether that’s by working towards your desired career path, building up your savings, or volunteering locally. Today we’re going to share our five top suggestions for having a productive summer break this year.\n\n1. Learn a New Language\nLearning a new language is one of the best ways to make the most of your summer break in 2021. You’ll find plenty of apps and courses available online, many of which are free or very inexpensive. To completely immerse yourself in your learning, we recommend completing an in-person course or lessons. While apps and technology are a great tool for beginners, speaking to a real human is the best way to get ahead with language learning. Speaking a second language can benefit you in so many ways and may increase your employment chances in the future.\n\n2. Volunteering\nIf you are looking for a rewarding way to spend your summer break from school, consider volunteering this summer. You’ll enjoy putting your efforts into improving someone else’s life and find that you learn and grow a lot from this experience. Regardless of your interests, you’ll find a volunteering experience to suit your needs. Popular types of volunteering include environmental projects, animal welfare, and teaching. While there are many great projects locally, you may want to consider going abroad to volunteer this summer if you can.\n\n3. Build Your Savings\nWhether you already have a part-time job or are on the hunt for one, summer is a great time to pick up extra hours at your job. Before heading to college, it’s a good idea to boost your savings, as you’ll never know when the extra cash will come in handy. It’s never too early in life to start saving for your future, and by working this summer, you’ll also learn various new skills at your job.\n\n4. Take an Internship\nFor individuals who already have a desired career path in mind, applying for an internship is one of the best ways to gain experience in the industry. This will look excellent on your resume while also building your skills and making connections that may assist with future employment. Some people even use this to test out a potential career path before committing to years of study in this field.\n\n5. Put Your Health First\nWhen we are busy with school and college, it’s easy to neglect our health. If your fitness levels or healthy eating plan have gone by the wayside this year at school, use the summer to reset and reprogram your mind ready for the year ahead. Spend time outdoors walking or cycling, and enjoy cooking from scratch at home.\n\nAll of these ideas will make for a productive summer break this year and will help to further your skills for your career or benefit your personal life. Try one or more of these ideas to make the most of your upcoming summer break, and at the end of your time off, you’ll look back proudly at how much you’ve achieved."

        "title":"7 Ways to End a Personal Statement",
        "type":"students",
        "text":"The introduction and ending of your personal statement are the most important parts of your writing. While many students spend hours crafting the perfect application, you’ll find that they often neglect to think about the impact the opening or closing has on their writing. These are seven of the top ways to close a personal statement to impress any college admissions officer who reads it this year.\n\n1. Talk About Your Future Expectations\nOne of the strongest ways to end your personal statement is with a sentence about your purpose in life and the potential your future studies will bring. Throughout your writing, you should share your experiences. These can wrap up nicely at the end of the work in a short paragraph to share the key expectations and hopes you have for your future.\n\n2. Share Your Thesis\nIf you are looking to create a unique personal statement ending, share your thesis or main idea at the very end. This will make a stronger impact than dropping it somewhere in the middle of your text and leave the college admissions officer with something to think about.\n\n3. Emphasize Your Values\nHaving strong values is integral for the success of any college student. By naming your values and morals at the end, you’ll show the reader what you stand for, and they’ll be left with a stronger sense of your motivation in life.\n\n4. Refer Back to Your Introduction\nTreating your personal statement like a loop and returning to the introduction adds a clear sense of finality to your essay. Pick up one key statement or fact from the opening paragraph and expand on this in your conclusion.\n\n5. State Your Intended Career\nWhile there’s a lot more to college than just aiming for a certain job role or career path, knowing where you are heading will show ambition and determination. Stating your intended career and how your studies will assist you to get there makes a powerful closing remark.\n\n6. Explain Why You Have Chosen This College or Course\nAnswering the simple question of why you are applying to a certain course is one of the best ways to end your personal statement. This is what any good piece of writing should cover, and your admissions officer will appreciate the research and interest you show in their college.\n\n7. A Plot Twist\nIf you’ve been using your personal statement to tell a story, a plot twist in the final paragraph will shock and surprise the reader. This will leave them with plenty to think about, and they’ll appreciate the creativity you show in your application.\n\nBy using any of these tactics, or a combination of a couple of them, you’ll leave a great impression on your college admissions officer. A personal statement is a chance for you to show your personality and unique writing skills, and you’ll want to set aside plenty of time to craft the perfect ending to your work. By relating the ending to the content and introduction of your personal statement, you’ll come full circle to make a memorable first impression on the reader."

        "title":"How do I get recruited as a College athlete",
        "type":"admissions",
        "text":"Many high school athletes dream of being recruited as a college athlete and work hard throughout their years in high school to train and develop their skills. However, the college athlete recruitment process is a very challenging one. With individuals from around the country fighting for limited places, it’s a long-winded and competitive process for everyone involved. If it’s your dream to be recruited as a college athlete, read our guide below to learn more about the application process and everything you can do to increase your chances of success in this area. \n\nBegin Thinking About the Process Early \nThe sooner you begin to think about the application process to become a college athlete, the better your chances of success. A freshman or sophomore student in high school has a good chance of beginning the process. Especially if you are already playing at All-State or varsity level, you will want to begin assessing your options early on. However, many students develop later on in their high school career, so it’s normal for students to begin the process in their junior year. You’ll find you won’t be judged for starting later on, and recruiters are very open to the fact that some people come to their sport much later than others. \n\nMake Connections \nWhile some high school athletes are sort out by recruiters, you’ll find this is less common nowadays. Most students need to take the initiative to reach out to teams or college coaches, and you can do this by email. You’ll need to share your academic achievements and your personal qualifications and statistics. If you don’t know where to start with this procedure, there are also recruitment services that can assist you with the process. These can be either free or paid, and they can also advise you on scholarships and the best places to apply. \n\nThe College Athlete Recruitment Funnel \nThousands of athletes take part in the college athlete recruitment process each year, and this funnels down to just a few successful individuals. Many applicants are considered at the start of the process, and they’ll be filtered out depending on their height, weight, position, and other basic requirements. During each stage, more assessments are taken to try and narrow it down to the final few successful candidates. Near the end of the process, coaches begin visiting potential recruits, and following a successful visit, this can result in an offer being shared to join a college team. \n\nHow to Stand Out from the Crowd \nWith so many applicants each year fighting for just a few positions, you may be wondering how you can stand out and improve your recruitment chances. You’ll want to show initiative throughout your contact with college coaches, and your introductory email should work to share your aspirations and achievements. If you are lucky enough to meet potential coaches, they’ll look at how easy you take directions, your potential leadership skills, your teamwork and energy levels, and your drive. These all come together to create a well-rounded athlete that a coach will find easy to train during their college years. \n\nDivision Levels \nIf you have a good idea of what you are aiming towards in your athletic career, you’ll want to decide which division level you are aspiring to compete within. The highest level of college sports is NCAA Division I, and just underneath this, you’ll find NCAA Division II. The highest level expects athletes to train intensively, and you’ll be required to travel throughout your time. However, you’ll also benefit from great facilities and larger budgets on campus. At NCAA Division II, you’ll see that scholarships are also available, but you may find your work-life balance to be a little better. \n\nDropping down to NCAA Division III, you’ll find no scholarships are available now, although there may be other opportunities for assistance. Academics are of higher importance at this level, and your season will be shorter. Finally, NAIA is a smaller group of schools, and NJCAA is available as a junior college option for anyone testing out college athletics or looking to save money. \n\nAre Academics Important for College Athletes? \nIf your dream is to play as a college or professional athlete, you may think that you don’t need to worry about your academics any longer if you are a talented athlete. Our advice to anyone applying as a college athlete is to still put a lot of time and effort into your academic results. This is one of the first things that’s looked at during the application process, and you’ll want to check out the requirements for any colleges you are applying to. Even if you are the most talented player on the field, this won’t guarantee entrance to your top college choice if your grades are poor. Hard work and dedication are reflected in your academic results, and this is something that any coach will be looking for from their players. If you are worried about finding scholarships for college, good academics and test scores will often increase the options available to you. \n\nExpect Rejection \nWhen it comes to getting recruited as a college athlete, you need to understand that rejection is just part of the process. If you’ve been playing for many years, you are probably used to this feeling, but you’ll need a lot of patience to succeed in the college athlete recruitment season. Expect this process to be very tiring and for it to push you to your limits, both physically and mentally. However, the excitement of being accepted in the end will be well worth the struggle, so keep going even on the toughest days of the process. \n\nBeing recruited as a college athlete is a dream for many high school athletes. By following these tips above and reaching out to colleges across the country, you’ll increase your chances of success in the recruitment process this year. Remember, it’s going to be a long and challenging ride, but one that will all pay off when you are representing your team in college and doing something you love every day."

        "title":"How many colleges should I apply to",
        "type":"admissions",
        "text":"With hundreds of colleges to choose from across the country, it can be incredibly difficult for students to narrow down their choices. While you may have an idea of the college you’d most like to attend, it’s important not to put all of your hope into one application. By applying to a variety of colleges, you’ll increase your chances of finding the perfect fit for your future education. But how many colleges should you apply for? We’re here to help you pick the ideal number of colleges to complete applications for this year. \n\nWhat is the Average Number of Colleges That Students Apply For? \nYou’ll find most students choose to apply for between seven and ten colleges. This number covers the schools at the top of your wish list, a few safety schools, and a few aspirational colleges. Your safety schools should be colleges that you have a very good chance of getting into, based on your current grades. Aspirational or reach colleges are ones that you feel you’ll struggle to get into but would be worth a shot based on the current statistics. While you don’t have to apply for ten colleges, you’ll find that it will give you the opportunity to cover a wide range of colleges and increase your chances of finding success during the application season. \n\nHow to Select the Number of Colleges to Apply For \nThe number of colleges you will apply for is dependent on the type of colleges you are looking at. If you are applying for selective and competitive colleges, you’ll want to consider applying for even more than ten colleges to ensure you have a choice of places to attend. The top colleges in the country have a very low acceptance rate, so if your ten applications only consist of these, you may be setting yourself up for failure. Each college is looking for something different in their applications each year, so by spreading your chances around between a variety of colleges, you’ll find the perfect fit for your college years. \n\nFor a whole host of reasons, many students today end up applying for fewer colleges than the average person. If you apply early decision and are selected, you won’t need to complete other applications. Another huge consideration is the fee involved in each application. While there is some support available to students, there’s generally a fee of around $75 per application, on top of receiving your reports for the SAT or ACT. When you start applying for seven to ten colleges, these fees quickly add up, and for many students, this just isn’t something that’s accessible to them. \n\nCollege applications take a lot of time and effort, and crafting the perfect personal statement or essay is very time-consuming. If you are doing this for multiple colleges, you’ll want to ensure you have space in your schedule to create high-quality applications for each one. If you are struggling to find the time for this, you may be better off focusing on fewer colleges and giving each application your best shot. Finally, if you are looking for something very specific from your college application, you may find you are only willing to apply for a few. Whether that’s a certain course or elite sports facilities, this may limit your choices significantly. \n\nThere’s no right or wrong answer when it comes to how many colleges to apply for. By applying for a few safety schools as well as your top choices, you’ll increase your chances of success during the college application period this year."

        "title":"How to choose my major",
        "type":"admissions",
        "text":"Choosing your college major is a lot more challenging than you may initially think. While it’s easy to follow your passions and interests, there’s more to consider when selecting a major than just choosing a subject you enjoy. Today we’re going to look at the key factors to research when choosing your college major. \n\nEmployment Rates \nWhile your first job may seem a long time away when you are just starting college, the time will come around much quicker than you could ever imagine. You want to set yourself up for a good return-on-investment for your college education. If you are spending thousands of dollars on your education, take the time to consider your potential career path. Research job market figures, and check out the likelihood of finding a job in your desired field. Sometimes just slightly tweaking your major may open up a whole new world of possibilities. If you study something too specialized, you may find job opportunities to be very limited after graduation. \n\nYour Interests and Skills \nNaturally, we all want to do something in life that we enjoy, but that can’t always be the case when it comes to working. If you are particularly skilled or knowledgeable in a certain field, that’s a strong reason to follow that career path. Pursuing your passions is also very important in life, but this must be looked at with a sense of reality as well. If the field you are interested in entering is incredibly competitive, be honest with yourself about whether this is a route worth taking. \n\nSalary Expectations \nWhen looking at your return-on-investment for your college years, you’ll want to look at the predicted salary for your major. Jobs that require extensive training and years of college often generate higher salaries, but that’s not always the case. It’s important to set yourself up with realistic expectations about what you can expect to earn upon graduation. Certain majors are far more desirable in the current job market, and you may find the high salary is a reason to consider adjusting your career path. \n\nThe Workload \nCertain majors, such as the social sciences, are expected to write a higher number of essays throughout each college year. If essay writing is something you despise, this may be reason enough to switch your intended major. If one part of the course makes up a high percentage of your overall grade, when it’s something you don’t enjoy doing, this could ruin your potential employment chances. Try to find a major that you’ll enjoy studying and that allows you to continue engaging in other college activities or sports you are passionate about. \n\nChoosing a college major that you are excited to study will help to motivate you through your years in college. However, it’s important for young people to be realistic about employment opportunities and salaries, to allow them to live a comfortable and enjoyable life in the future. Take the time to compare various majors for your time at college before settling on the one which will bring you the most pleasure during your college years. "

        "title":"How to get financial aid for college",
        "type":"admissions",
        "text":"College is an incredibly exciting time in any young person’s life but does come with some challenges. One of the areas which causes a lot of stress and anxiety for college applicants is financing their course. Your years at college will be some of the most expensive of your life, and many people spend most of their adult life repaying their student loans. However, a college education can put you ahead in so many ways in life, so it’s well worth it for the qualifications you will receive. Today we’re going to share with you the steps to applying for financial aid for college this year. \n\nResearch Your Options \nStart planning as early as possible for your college education. When you are in high school, take the time to speak to your school counselors, who will be able to advise you about the options available to you. There may be grants and scholarships you can apply for within your state, college, or from a non-profit organization. If you are able to, start putting any money aside you have from a part-time job, or look into prepaid tuition and saving plans, such as the 529 plan, which offers financial aid and tax benefits. From there, you’ll be prepared to apply for any grants and loans when the time is right during the college application process. \n\nCompleting Your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) \nFollowing the end of the tax year and before your first year of college, you’ll want to complete your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This form allows you to apply for federal grants, loans, and work-study funding. Your college will then take the information on your form and consider what federal aid options you are eligible for. A lot of colleges today also use these forms to grant their own funding. Upon completion of this form, you receive a Student Aid Report. Anyone who is a U.S. citizen or an eligible noncitizen can complete this form if they need financial assistance. Ensure you meet all of the eligibility requirements to avoid disappointment further down the line. \n\nYour Aid Offer \nUpon completion of the FAFSA, you will receive an aid offer. This breaks down the type of funding, and the amount of funding a college would offer you. You’ll also receive information on your expected costs for the year. For anyone who has been accepted into several colleges, you’ll be able to compare your options between each one that’s offered you funding. At this point, you’ll want to take a good amount of time to review your aid offer and then consider your budget for each year to ensure the college you accept financial aid from is affordable to you. From there, you can accept the aid offer from the college that’s best suited to your needs. You’ll also need to disclose to them at this point other scholarships or financial aid you are expecting to assist you with college. \n\nHow to Choose Between Colleges \nIf you are lucky enough to have been accepted into multiple colleges and receive financial aid offers from a few of them, you’ll want to figure out the net cost of attending each school. This will allow you to compare your options and decide which will be the most affordable and realistic college to attend in the long run. The cost of attending each college should be listed on the aid offer, and you’ll need to know the tuition cost, living expenses, and other miscellaneous fees you may need to cover during your education. From there, you can take away any grants and scholarships, as well as any savings you may have. You’ll be left with the net cost of attending this school, which you can then compare against other colleges. \n\nAfter this process, you may want to look at loans or securing a job to assist with the additional fees you need to pay. If your aid offer also includes student loans, make sure you are considering how much you will need to repay in the future and how long this process will take. Research private loans very carefully before committing to anything, as these often have many terms and conditions that should not be overlooked by students. \n\nStarting College \nOnce you’ve accepted your financial aid, you will be ready to head to the college of your dreams. The financial aid office at your new college will automatically apply your aid to any fees you need to pay, and then you are sent anything that’s left to spend on living expenses or any equipment or supplies you may need for school. However, something students often overlook are the requirements for financial aid. One of the terms of receiving this aid is that you must continue to progress academically during your time in college. Ensure you are staying on top of your studies at all times, especially if you have to balance a job during your college years as well. Each year, you’ll need to fill in another FAFSA, so make sure you don’t overlook the deadlines for this. \n\nAfter Graduation \nYour years at college will undoubtedly fly by, and as you are getting ready to graduate and head out into the world of employment, remember you’ll need to account for your student loan repayments. You’ll have a six-month window on federal student loans before you need to make repayments, giving you a good amount of time to secure a job after college. Consider your repayment plan options upon graduation, and use this short window to set yourself up for success in the future. If you are struggling at any point with repayment, make sure you speak to your loan provider immediately. They’ll be able to share the different repayment options with you to find one that best suits your current situation. \nApplying for college is an exciting yet overwhelming time in a young person’s life. By following these tips and completing your FAFSA on time each year, you’ll set yourself up for a financially secure time at college. "

        "title":"Ways to Stand Out on your Admissions Essay",
        "type":"admissions",
        "text":"Your college admissions essay is one of the most powerful parts of your overall application. It gives you the chance to showcase your personality and provides college admissions officers with a deeper insight into you as a person and why you are interested in attending their college. While good grades are a big part of your college application, never overlook or rush your college admissions essay even if your grades are exceptional. When you are being compared side-by-side with someone for one place, the admissions essay will likely be the final decider in the admissions process. If you are looking to make your essay stand out from the crowd this year, follow these simple tips below for writing an effective admissions essay. \n\n1. A Strong and Attention-Grabbing Introduction \nThe introduction to your admissions essay should grab your reader’s attention from the first few words. As with any piece of writing or academic work, a reader often judges the entire essay from just the first impression. While this may seem unfair, remember college admissions officers are reading hundreds of essays, and they’ll all very quickly start to seem the same after a while. Your opening paragraph should be unique and offer a clear insight into what will be covered in your writing. It should set the tone for your admissions essay while still also being intriguing enough for the recipient to continue reading further into the essay. Starting with a fun anecdote or shocking fact can grab your reader’s attention and make you stand out straight away. \n\n2. Don’t Be Too Serious \nWhile applying for college is certainly a serious matter, your admissions essay should also showcase your personality. Adding a little humor into your essay is never a bad idea and will certainly break up the repetition for the admissions officer. It only needs to be one or two sentences long, as opposed to a whole comedic essay, but it will be enough to bring a smile to someone’s face. A funny opening line can then transition into a more deep and meaningful conversation about the topic of your choice. You want the reader to have a complete idea of your personality, interests, and aspirations from the essay, but it doesn’t need to be done in a serious or boring manner to achieve this desired result. \n\n3. Discuss Unique Interests \nThere are simply hundreds of interests a high school student could have, but the majority of college applicants focus on the same topics. While team sports, academic pursuits, and leadership skills are important to highlight, if you have an unusual interest or hobby, use your admissions essay as a chance to showcase this. When you write about something that lights you up, this will be reflected in your work and make your essay stand out from the hundreds of others that are being reviewed that day. If you are worried that your interests are too niche or bizarre, they are probably the exact type of thing you should be writing about. Of course, you’ll want to link your interests to your education and college application. This should be fairly simple to do, as most activities teach us important skills and help to develop us as individuals. Highlight leadership, teamwork, dedication, and commitment within any passion you mention. \n\n4. The Presentation of Your Admissions Essay \nWe often spend so much time worrying about the content of an essay and completely overlook its format. Ensure you are consistent throughout your writing, especially when it comes to writing dates and numbers. Use an attractive font and a simple but effective format that will stand out in a pile of admissions essays. Break your essay into readable sections, and don’t let your paragraphs get too long. While this may sound like very basic advice, you’ll be surprised how many students overlook this. \n\nFinally, ensure you have read your admissions essay multiple times before submitting it. Even just one or two grammatical or spelling errors could completely throw the reader off when reading your essay and change their opinion on your writing. These are some of the most common mistakes high school students make, but submitting a perfect admissions essay will showcase your attention to detail and maturity. \n\n5. Follow a Logical Structure \nWhen you are reading an essay or book, there’s nothing worse than repetitive text or a story that is written in a manner that’s difficult to follow. Your admissions essay should follow a clear structure and a logical order. By reading your essay a few times before submitting it, you can check the transitions and paragraphs are ordered in a sensible manner. The introduction and conclusion should form the bookends of your writing and help to make the work come around in a full circle by the end. Ask your parents or a teacher to read your essay through and take their feedback onboard. You’ll want to ask them if the order and structure made sense and if they could follow the story you are trying to tell throughout your writing. \n\n6. Wrap Up Your Essay with the Conclusion \nThe conclusion is the final chance you have to make a good first impression on the reader. Just as you want to take time and care to craft the perfect introduction, do the same with the conclusion. The conclusion shouldn’t suddenly introduce anything new or shocking that should be discussed earlier on in the work. Instead, it should work to loop back round to what you started discussing at the very beginning of your work. Your conclusion doesn’t need to be particularly long but should make a final statement that will win over any college admissions officer. \n\nYour college admissions essay is something you’ll want to take your time writing. By planning your essay in advance and following a clear structure, you’ll write the perfect essay that will excite and intrigue any reader. Make sure you read your essay repeatedly before submitting it to minimize the chance of making minor errors. These small details are always noticed by college admissions officers and will make or break your chance of getting into your top college. "

While many jobs don’t involve performing in the same manner as the arts, you’ll often need good presentation and communication skills to share your ideas and projects. \n\nWork Experience \nDon’t overlook the importance of adding work experience to your college application. Even a part-time or summer job can help you stand out, and it shows you have a strong work ethic, are a team player, and have good time management skills. So many jobs that high school students do develop customer service and people skills, and you’ll find they give you the confidence to meet and interact with new people when you attend college. You’ll find a lot of people don’t have work experience when they head to college, so it will show your willingness to use your time productively and your excitement to enter into the workforce in the future. \n\nIT Skills \nIt may seem like every high school student nowadays has good IT skills, but any skills that are considered out of the norm should be highlighted on your college application.
